Since the dawn of history, there are noobs fooled by the propaganda of boobs, which is "the bigger is better".

IMHO, how big or small doesn't matter as long as I can play with and what's more important is the sensitivity if you ask me.

As you may know, boobs are not only physical matter, but also philosophical matter. They are mountains, but valleys at the same time. Why?

These days, the number of uncanny valley is augmenting and it's sometimes difficult to tell artificial boobs and natural one apart.

But as long as they are small, they tend to be natural. 

May the small boobs be with us.
