Convenience and privacy are often a trade-off, and the same is true for payment methods.
Basically, all kinds of data are being collected and sold.
Unless we are the buyer of the data, we won't be able to know what form of data is being sold.
It would be nice if the payment could be made in a form that does not tie to personal information.
Let's try to take the balance between convenience and privacy.

## Types of payment options
- Cash
- Electronic money (card type)
- Credit card (debit, prepaid)
- Mobile payment (barcode, NFC)
- Others (store- or affiliate-specific currency, etc.)

## Pros and Cons
When privacy is important, cash is still the best choice.
The next best is Suica and other transportation e-money (no-name card type).
The table below shows a simple comparison.

| ---                   | ---              | ---             |
|                       | Account required | Data collection |
| Cash                  | -                | -               |
| IC card(Suica, Pasmo) | -                | ✔               |
| Credit Card           | ✔                | ✔               |
| Mobile Payment        | ✔                | ✔               |


### Cash
No account required, no data collection, can be used at any store.

### IC card(Suica, Pasmo)
talking about physical ic card.

> You can buy IC card(Suica) at ticket vending machines at JR stations for a 500 yen deposit. You can recharge at stations, convenience stores, basically in person at the registar, but ATMs are also available at Seven-Eleven.

No account required, but data collected. Available at many stores.

UID (card number), balance, date of use, and details of use (e.g., train ride from A to B, purchase of goods, etc.) are recorded.
Data is collected, but acceptable as long as it is anonymous and not tied to PII[^1](Personal Identifiable Information).

- Since you can have as many cards as you like, they can be used for different purposes, such as transportation or buying some stuff.
- No need to wait for authorization, so payment is fast.
- There are some precautions compared to cash, such as the fact that part of the UID is recorded on the receipt and the risk of skimming and loss.

### Other payment options

モバイル決済は､そもそもスマホ限定のアプリを入れる必要があるため好ましくない｡サービスの仕組み自体も閉鎖的であり､｢この機能を使うには提携口座の開設が必要です｣などややこしい仕組みがある｡また独占と排他の結果､利用可能店舗の制限がある｡特に今はビジネス上のフォーカスが当てられているため､競争の影響を受けやすいのかもしれない｡
スマホアプリを必要としないクレジットカードの方が閉鎖的ではなく､シンプルで利用しやすいと感じる｡

モバイルスイカはアカウント不要で利用できるが､スマホが前提となっているため省く｡

## 終いに

無記名の交通系カード(Suicaカードなど)をベースに決済し､使用できない場所では現金で支払う｡これであれば､プライバシーをある程度重視しつつ､電子マネーの利便性を享受できそうだ｡

現金支払いの際には､コインホルダーを財布に忍ばせておくと､幾分ラクだ｡![コインホルダー](/img/coin-holder.jpg)
