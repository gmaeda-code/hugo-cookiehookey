Brastel's my050 is now [chargeable(application fee and maintenance fee)](https://brastel-info-japanese.blogspot.com/2022/04/blog-post.html) and requires [personal identification documents](https://brastel-info-japanese.blogspot.com/2022/07/my-050.html) for new applications.
I once used another 050 number service, smatalk,  and was automatically terminated without realizing it. 
So, Brastel users beware.

According to the [terms of service](https://www.brastel.com/my050/jpn#info), if you are on the old plan (no maintenance fee), my050 will be terminated after one year of no charges or paid calls.
If you use it, it will be extended for one year each time you use it.

In other words, it would only be necessary to use the service within one year from the date of last use. 
As for identity verification, it seems that it is not retroactively required since it is required at the time of signing up.
