If you click on the link of Rakuten Mobile on the top page of Rakuten Ichiba, you will instantly redirected to a different page than viewport.
The url displayed in the lower left viewport will change to another url by JavaScript the moment you click on it.

It doesn't make sense to have the practice of checking viewport for security. It looks like a phishing ploy.
