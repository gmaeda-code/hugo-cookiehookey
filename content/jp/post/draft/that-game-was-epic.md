I don't play video games these days. 
So, the games I know are in the good old days.
Those games below are the ones that I thought that was epic. 

ゲームを最近プレイすることはないため､プレイしていたゲームというと､古き良き?と言われるものになる｡

## TRUE BLUE
- https://www.tomoshibi.net/main.html

This game is released from tomoshibi.
I played it on Windows XP.
What is interesting about it is, you are fallen into the magical world where you don't understand a single word its residents say.
So you basically have to build your own dictionary to proceed the story.
While building your own dictionary, you fight against monsters and enemies like all other RPGs.


## SPRINTER & SPRINTER2

This game is about Track & Field(100 meter dash?).
Developing the sprint ability and beating the rivals, aiming for winning nationwide championship.
As I was the member of the T&F club, not the sprinter though, really enjoyed playing it.
