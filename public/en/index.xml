For privacy reasons, virtual currency is a good choice, but it takes time and effort to obtain. In this article, I will focus on V-Preca Gift, which is more readily available. Unlike virtual currency, it cannot be used to pay restricted products because it is based on Visa payments.</description></item><item><title>Ordinary day</title><link>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/ordinary-day/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/ordinary-day/</guid><description>The place that was there, the time that was there, and the ordinary day that was taken for granted was there.
I&amp;rsquo;m not aware that the ordinary day is now and here.
Only if it&amp;rsquo;s gone away, I understand it was there.
I wonder what kind of ordinary day I&amp;rsquo;ll have to realize hereafter.</description></item><item><title>Careful not to lose my050 number</title><link>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/careful-not-to-lose-my050-number/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/careful-not-to-lose-my050-number/</guid><description>Brastel&amp;rsquo;s my050 is now chargeable(application fee and maintenance fee) and requires personal identification documents for new applications. I once used another 050 number service, smatalk, and was automatically terminated without realizing it. So, Brastel users beware.
According to the terms of service, if you are on the old plan (no maintenance fee), my050 will be terminated after one year of no charges or paid calls. If you use it, it will be extended for one year each time you use it.</description></item><item><title>Ransomware by the name of Facebook</title><link>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/ransomware-by-the-name-of-facebook/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/ransomware-by-the-name-of-facebook/</guid><description>I have a part of me that Facebook is ransomware. The other day, I typed in the legit credentials and 2FA on Facebook sign-in page in vain. Facebook didn&amp;rsquo;t let me log in. The page said, as far as I remember, that I tried to log in from the different device than usual. To top this all off, they asked me to turn on my identification, even though I surmised that they would have no way to prove it to be my ID.</description></item><item><title>Removing damp smell by detergent and bleach</title><link>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/detergent-and-bleach-to-remove-damp-smell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/detergent-and-bleach-to-remove-damp-smell/</guid><description>Detergent and bleach Detergent 部屋干しトップ 除菌EX Bleach クリアヒーロー Softener as you like

Apple should not override what the user has configured.
Apple and Bluetooth Apple makes location a commodity, i.e., Find My and AirTag, and to ensure its accuracy, it&amp;rsquo;s better for them to have something that can identify your location turned on all the time. Apple uses Bluetooth to communicate with nearby iPhones. Even though GPS, mobile connection(cellular and data connections), and Wi-Fi are turned off, if Bluetooth is turned on, they can determine iPhone&amp;rsquo;s location by Apple&amp;rsquo;s network.</description></item><item><title>UTM parameters in ProtonVPN email</title><link>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/protonvpn-utm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookiehookey.v6.rocks/en/protonvpn-utm/</guid><description>ProtonVPN ProtonVPN is a VPN service affiliated with ProtonMail.

The url displayed in the lower left viewport will change to another url by JavaScript the moment you click on it.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have the practice of checking viewport for security. It looks like a phishing ploy.</description></item></channel></rss>
