According to the terms of service, if you are on the old plan (no maintenance fee), my050 will be terminated after one year of no charges or paid calls.

For kWh, the standard unit price for electric power consumption set by Home Electric Appliances Fair Trade Conference is 27 yen/kWh (from 2014), now became 31 yen/kWh in 2022.</description></item></channel></rss>
